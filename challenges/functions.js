// ==== Callbacks ====  

/* Step 1: Create a callback function
  * Create a function named consume that can take 3 parameters.
  * The first two parameteres can accept any argument
  * The last parameter accepts a callback 
  * In the body of the function return the callback with the two parameters that you created
*/
const consume = (param1, param2, cb) => {
  cb(param1, param2);
}


/* Step 2: Create several functions to callback with consume();
  * Create a function named add that returns the sum of two numbers
  * Create a function named multiply that returns the product of two numbers 
  * Create a function named greeting that accepts a first and last name and returns "Hello first-name last-name, nice to meet you!"
*/

const add = (x, y) => {
  console.log(x + y);
  return x + y;
}

const multiply = (x, y) => {
  console.log(x * y);
  return x * y;
}

const greeting = (firstName, lastName) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}, nice to meet you!`);
  return `Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}, nice to meet you!`;
}


/* Step 3: Check your work by uncommenting the following calls to consume(): */
consume(2,2,add); // 4
consume(10,16,multiply); // 160
consume("Mary","Poppins", greeting); // Hello Mary Poppins, nice to meet you!


// ==== Closures ==== 
// Question 1: Explain in your own words why the example below is a closure.

// Explanation: Both functions are referencing variables that are outside their own scope, looking outward. The closure is the lexical environment in which the function was invoked, meaning it had access to those outside variables.

// Question 2: Given the example below, what scope is the external variable in? Global.

let external = "I'm outside!";

function myFunction() {
  let internal = "Hello! I'm inside the function";
  console.log(external);

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  };
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();
