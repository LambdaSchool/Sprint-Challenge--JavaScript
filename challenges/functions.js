// ==== Callbacks ====  

/* Step 1: Create a higher-order function
  * Create a higher-order function named consume with 3 parameters: a, b and cb
  * The first two parameters can take any argument (we can pass any value as argument)
  * The last parameter accepts a callback
  * The consume function should return the invocation of cb, passing a and b into cb as arguments
*/
function consume(a, b, cb) {
	return cb(a, b);
}

/* Step 2: Create several functions to callback with consume();
  * Create a function named add that returns the sum of two numbers
  * Create a function named multiply that returns the product of two numbers 
  * Create a function named greeting that accepts a first and last name and returns "Hello first-name last-name, nice to meet you!"
*/
function add(num1, num2) {
	return num1 + num2;
}

function mutiply(num1, num2) {
	return num1 * num2;
}

function greeting(fName, lName) {
	return 'Hello ${fName} ${lName}, nice to meet you!';
}


/* Step 3: Check your work by un-commenting the following calls to consume(): */
console.log(consume(2, 2, add)); // 4
console.log(consume(10, 16, multiply)); // 160
console.log(consume("Mary", "Poppins", greeting)); // Hello Mary Poppins, nice to meet you!


// ==== Closures ==== 

// Explain in your own words why nestedfunction can access the variable internal.


// Explanation: 
/*A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function’s variables, and it has access to the global variables.
The inner function has access not only to the outer function’s variables, but also to the outer function’s parameters. Note that the inner function cannot call the outer function’s arguments object, however, even though it can call the outer function’s parameters directly.
You create a closure by adding a function inside another function, i.e. creating a nestedFunction.*/


const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  };
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();
