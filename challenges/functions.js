// ==== Callbacks ====  

/* Step 1: Create a function that accepts a callback
  * Create a function named consume that can take 3 parameters.
  * The first two parameteres can accept any argument
  * The last parameter accepts a callback 
  * In the body of the function return the callback with the two parameters that you created
*/

let consume = function(a, b, cb){
  return cb(a, b);
}



/* Step 2: Create several functions to callback with consume();
  * Create a function named add that returns the sum of two numbers
  * Create a function named multiply that returns the product of two numbers 
  * Create a function named greeting that accepts a first and last name and returns "Hello first-name last-name, nice to meet you!"
*/

let add = (a, b) => a + b;
let multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
let greeting = (firstname, lastname) => `Hello ${firstname} ${lastname}, nice to meet you!`;

/* Step 3: Check your work by uncommenting the following calls to consume(): */
console.log(consume(2,2,add)); // 4
console.log(consume(10,16,multiply)); // 160
console.log(consume("Mary","Poppins", greeting)); // Hello Mary Poppins, nice to meet you!


// ==== Closures ==== 
// Explain in your own words why `nestedfunction()` can access the variable `internal`.
// Explanation: 
// Because it is nested in the scope of it's parent and therefore has access to variables of its parent's scope and the global scope. That's the beauty of closures. I believe that this is possible because of the way that Javascript executes function and builds (not my own words) an execution stack. 


const external = "I'm outside the function";

function myFunction() {
  console.log(external);
  const internal = "Hello! I'm inside myFunction!";

  function nestedFunction() {
    console.log(internal);
  };
  nestedFunction();
}
myFunction();
