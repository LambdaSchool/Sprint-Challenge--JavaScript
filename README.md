# Assessing your JavaScript Fundamentals
This sprint you worked really hard on learning the fundamentals of JavaScript! This sprint challenge will touch on each concept covered throughout this week.  Follow each task in order but feel free to skip something if you're struggling and come back to it later.

* This project is to be worked on alone but you can use outside resources. You can _reference_ any old code you may have and the training kit content.

## Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

* [ ] Fork the project into your GitHub user account
* [ ] Clone the forked project into a directory on your machine
* [ ] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE

## Task 2: Comprehension Questions
Answer the following questions to the best of your ability. You can exercise your Googling skills and use training kit.  Open up the [Answers.md](Answers.md) file and record your responses there.

1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
// forEach does a function for each array element...map creates a totally new function with results from a function on every element in the calling array.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
// Funcitons are defined outside of a class and are independent of an object while methods are defined inside and on an object.  

3. What is closure?  
// It's an inside function that has access to an outside function's variables

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
1. Window Binding - Points to the global/window scope if strict mode isn't used or a specific object isn't defined. (forest and tree example)
2. Implicit Binding - Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this.
3. Whenever a constructor function is made/used, this refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function. (example Humanoid class then more huamnoids made like wizard or swordsman)
4. Explicit Binding - 

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

#### Pro tip for this challenge: If something seems like it isn't working locally, copy and paste your code up to codepen and take another look at the console.

## Task 3: Objects and Arrays
Test your knowledge of objects and arrays. 
* [ ] Use the [objects-arrays.js](challenges/objects-arrays.js) link to get started.  Read the instructions carefully!

## Task 4: Functions
This challenge takes a look at callbacks and closures as well as scope. 
* [ ] Use the [functions.js](challenges/functions.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

## Task 5: Prototypes
Create constructors, bind methods, and create cuboids in this prototypes challenge.
* [ ] Use the [prototypes.js](challenges/prototypes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

## Task 6: Classes
Once you have completed the prototypes challenge, it's time to convert all your hard work into classes.
* [ ] Use the [classes.js](challenges/classes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

**Congratulations, you completed the sprint challenge!**
