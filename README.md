# Assessing your JavaScript Fundamentals
This sprint you worked really hard on learning the fundamentals of JavaScript! This sprint challenge will touch on each concept covered throughout this week.  Follow each task in order but feel free to skip something if you're struggling and come back to it later.

* This project is to be worked on alone but you can use outside resources. You can _reference_ any old code you may have and the training kit content.

## Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

* [ ] Fork the project into your GitHub user account
* [ ] Clone the forked project into a directory on your machine
* [ ] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE

## Task 2: Comprehension Questions
Answer the following questions to the best of your ability. You can exercise your Googling skills and use training kit.  Open up the [Answers.md](Answers.md) file and record your responses there.

1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
for each each loops and compares while grab loops and plugs in while looping 

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
method is an action that can be performed on objects while objecgts are procedures of tasks that can are contained in a functin and block scope.

3. What is closure?
4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
global/window binding: when in global scope, the value of this will be in window object.
implicit binding: whenever an object is called by the key on the left side of the dot.
new binding: inherits properties from the mainconstructor template.
explicit binding: whenever the js built-in method apply call or bind are used, that is explcit binding

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
it's to pass any new attributes to the main constructor parent template object

#### Pro tip for this challenge: If something seems like it isn't working locally, copy and paste your code up to codepen and take another look at the console.

## Task 3: Objects and Arrays
Test your knowledge of objects and arrays. 
* [ ] Use the [objects-arrays.js](challenges/objects-arrays.js) link to get started.  Read the instructions carefully!

## Task 4: Functions
This challenge takes a look at callbacks and closures as well as scope. 
* [ ] Use the [functions.js](challenges/functions.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

## Task 5: Prototypes
Create constructors, bind methods, and create cuboids in this prototypes challenge.
* [ ] Use the [prototypes.js](challenges/prototypes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

## Task 6: Classes
Once you have completed the prototypes challenge, it's time to convert all your hard work into classes.
* [ ] Use the [classes.js](challenges/classes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

**Congratulations, you completed the sprint challenge!**
