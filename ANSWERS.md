4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

    >1. **Window Binding** - In the global scope, "this" points to the window/console object.
    >2. **Implicit Binding** - When a function is invoked, "this" points to the preceding object.
    >3. **New Binding** - When a constructor function is invoked, "this" points to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
    >4. **Explicit Binding** - When the call or apply methods are invoked, "this" is explicitly defined.
