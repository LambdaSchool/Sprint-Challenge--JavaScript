2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
  2. Answer: The difference between a function and an method is that a function is outside of a parent object and a method lives within an object.
3. What is closure?
  3. Answer: Closure is unique in that the function will go outside of it's local scope to reference a variable. I don't know where the word lexical comes into play.
4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
  4. Answer:
    Window Binding: :this: could be bound to the window or the view-port that :this: is in if not placed more specifically.
    Implicit Binding: :this: is implied on where it is meant to reference. Its area of reference is automatically assumed.
    Explicit Binding: :this: is explicitly stated what is to be refrenced.
    New Binding: :this: is used in a constructor function to create a new binding for use in other instances.
