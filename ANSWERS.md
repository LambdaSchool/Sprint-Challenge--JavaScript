# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Markdown.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
The main difference is that forEach() does not return anything. map() transforms each item and returns a new array of the same length.
2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
A method is a function within a class.
3. What is closure?
A closure is an embedded function with access to variables/methods of its outer function.
4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
1) is the function called by 'new'
2) is the function called by call(), apply(), or bind()
3) is the function called as a method (as in obj.method())
4) is the function called in the global scope( returns undefined or window)
5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
the super() call routes the common parameters back to the parent class. This avoids repeated lines of code.
