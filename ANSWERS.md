# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.


1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
MDN states:
* 'The `.forEach` method executes a provided function once for each array element.'
* 'The `.map` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.'

So basically what that means is: `.foreach` just goes at the array, no copy. High risk. `.map`, makes a new array that it then messes with.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?




3. What is closure?




4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.




5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
