# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

    MAP CREATES A NEW ARRAY.  BOTH EXECUTE A FUNCTION ON EACH ARRAY ELEMENT.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

    A METHOD IS A PROPERTY ON AN OBJECT, THAT IS A FUNCTION.

3. What is closure?

    A CLOSURE IS A FUNCTION INSIDE OF ANOTHER FUNCTION.  

    THE INNER FUCTION HAS ACCESS TO ITS PARENTS VARIABLES AND METHODS, AND THEREBY IS ABLE TO ACCESS GLOBAL VARIABLES AND METHODS.  A CLOSURE CREATES PRIVATE VARIABLES THAT CANNOT BE MODIFIED OR SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE OF ITS LEXICAL SCOPE.  THE VALUES OF THE INNER FUNCTION CAN BE ACCESSED AFTER THE PARENT FUNCTION CLOSES.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

    GLOBAL:
        WHEN ALL OTHER BELOW RULES DON'T APPLY, THIS DEFAULTS TO THE WINDOW OBJECT.

    IMPLICIT: 
        LOOKS TO THE OBJECT ON THE LEFT OF THE FUNCTION CALL, WHICH IS BOUND TO 'this'.

    NEW: 
        WHEN USING CONSTRUCTOR FUCTIONS WITH KEYWORD 'new'.

    EXPLICIT: 
        TELLS A FUNCTION WHAT 'this' KEYWORD IS APPLIED TO.



5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

    SUPER() IS USED TO INVOKE AND ACCESS THE PARENT'S CONSTRUCTOR, METHODS, VARIABLES, AND 'THIS' KEYWORD.
