# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.

1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

The biggest difference between `.forEach` method and `.map` method is the `.forEach` method will iterate over each item in an array, but will not return a new array. The `.map` method will iterate over each item in an array and will return a new array.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

A function is a set of tasks or a block of code that is executed when called upon. A method is a function that is defined within an object.

3. What is closure?

Closure is the ability for a function to search for and access variables outside of its scope if it cannot find them within its own scope.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

The four rules of the 'this' keyword are:

  I. You must explicitly assign the 'this' keyword a value or it will use the Window object by default.

  II. Using the 'this' keyword within a object will implicitly reference the object itself.

  III. When creating an object using a constructor function, the new keyword will pass the 'this' keyword with the assign value of the object name to the constructor function.

  IV. In a constructor function, the 'this keyword' must be passed to the base constructor function if it is being used to inherit its properties and methods.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

We need the super() in an extended class to inherit properties and methods from the base class.
