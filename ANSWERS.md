4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
The four rules of the 'this' keyword are implicit, explicit, new, and window binding.
Implicit means look to the left of the dot and that is what 'this' refers to.
Explicit means we can invoke a funtion and set 'this' to what we want to refer with properties call, apply, and bind. Call passes in arguments one at a time.
Apply takes the whole array. Bind invokes the function and returns a new one.
