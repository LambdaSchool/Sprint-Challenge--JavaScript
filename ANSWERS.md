1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

    ForEach iterates through a array but does not return any values. With a forEach function, values need to be pushed into an existing array or changed in the existing array. The higher order function, map, returns a new array of the same size as the original array. 

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

    A method is a type of function that can be called from a key inside of an object. Methods are found inside of objects and classes.

3. What is closure?


4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
