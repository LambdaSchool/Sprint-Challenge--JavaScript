# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

forEach takes in an array and applies a callback function to each item via a for loop. map takes in an array and a callback and as it applies the callback to each item in a for loop it puts them into a new array


2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

a method is a function inside an object

3. What is closure?

the concept that where you put a variable will change how it can be used/accessed 

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

it always "points" to the window object until otherwise assigned
it can be implictly bound when used inside a function
it can explicitly bound when called to do so outside of a function
by using the new keyword you can bind it to other objects made by a constructor function

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

this allows for explicit binding of the "this" keyword
