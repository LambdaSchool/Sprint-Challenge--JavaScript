# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
.map returns a new array, forEach simply iterates over the array and returns nothing.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
Functions are defined outside of classes and Methods are inside of and a part of classes.

3. What is closure?
Closure describes the ability of a child to access parent data after scope has closed.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
 A) The .this is the global object in non-strict mode, and undefined in strict mode.
 B) The .this points to the object on which the function is called (whatâ€™s to the left of the period when the function is called.
 C) We can explicitly tell the JavaScript engine to set this to point to a certain value using call, apply or bind.
 D)Using the new keyword constructs a new object, and this points it.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
When used in a constructor, the super keyword appears alone and must be used before the this keyword is used. The super keyword can also be used to call functions on a parent object.
