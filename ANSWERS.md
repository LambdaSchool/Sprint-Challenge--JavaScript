1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`. ForEach will loop through an araay and allow you to do things with each item. map will perform similar to forEach but will produce a new array.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.   new   (call apply bind) obj.func(), so its creating a new object,  implicit or explict and the window  
5. Why do we need super() in an extended class? to access the inherited attributes or to establish them without the super keyword the extended class does not build upon the orginal class. like if name and age was in the parent class
without the super keyword  name and age would be undefined it may even not allow you to extend as i believe an error shows up requiring you to use the super keyword when extending.
