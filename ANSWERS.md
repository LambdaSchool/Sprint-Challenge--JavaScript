  I. You need to assign the 'this' keyword a value or it will use the Window object by default.

  II. Using the 'this' keyword within a object will reference the object itself.

  III. In a function, the 'this' keyword needs to be passed to another function that is being used to inherit properties and methods from.

  IV. In a class, you do not pass the 'this' keyword, but instead use the super function to pass the properties that have been received via the parameter of the class to the class that is being used to inherit properties and methods from.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

We need the super() in an extended class to pass the properties that have been received via the parameter of the extended class to the class that is being used to inherit properties and methods from.
