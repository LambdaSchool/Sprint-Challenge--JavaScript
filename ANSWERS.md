1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
Foreach doesn't return an array while .map can change the array and return a new one.
2. What is the difference between a function and a method? Methods belong to an object while functions are called by name and can choose to return values.
3. What is closure? The availability of certain values even after the function has executed to nested functions.

If the function is in the global scope, this will point to the window object.

Explicit binding is when a constructor function is used, this refers to the specific object created and returned by the constructor function. 
new Binding creates a new object and then the new object is set at the this.
