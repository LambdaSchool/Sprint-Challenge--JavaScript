# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.

1.  Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
    <!-- .forEach doesnt return anything the only thing it does is callback a provided function within your array. .Map actually returns an array of the same size utilizing the return values unlike .forEach. -->
2.  What is the difference between a function and a method?
    <!-- functions are defined outside of a class and a method is within a class -->
3.  What is closure?
    <!-- closure is basically telling you things are secure in the object or class that you are working in the whole code for example it has access to all the global variables -->
4.  Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
    <!-- If the keyword new is being used in the function it turns this into a whole new object.
    when the apply call and bind words are used to call a function the word this is used to be passed in the argument.
    if dot notation is being used then this is considered the object that the function is a property of.
    if a function is invoked as a free function this turns out to be a global object. -->
5.  Why do we need super() in an extended class?
    <!-- super is here for us to avoid duplicating the constructor parts -->
