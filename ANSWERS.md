# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`. -- .forEach steps through every element in the array and does something that could possibly change the original array. .map looks at elements from the original array and puts their changes into a new array so that the original array is unchanged.


2. What is the difference between a function and a method? -- A function does a job outside of any objects, while a method is a function inside an object that the object performs.


3. What is closure? -- Closure means that a function can look outside of itself for variables that it needs to do its job.


4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword. -- Window Binding means "this" refers to the window when it is in the global scope. Implicit Binding means that "this" refers to the first object to the left of the dot when a method is invoked. New Binding makes "this" refer to the object that has just been created. Explicit Binding means that we tell the compiler what "this" refers to in our code.


5. Why do we need super() in an extended class? -- super() lets the child prototype inherit everything in the parent prototype so that child can have the same properties and methods on top of their own unique ones.
