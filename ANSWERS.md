3. What is closure?
4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?



# Answers
1. The biggest difference is that .map returns a new array, .forEach doesn't. This just means that you have to give .map a variable for the array to be returned into. .forEach you can just straight up mess with the original array.
2. Basically the same thing, it's just where they're located at. A function inside of an object is a method. 
3. Closure is where the invokation of your function ends. Like if you have return value pushed to a global variable, your closure would end with that variable.
4. Explicit(methods), Implicit(.chaining), New(constructor), Window(global window).
5. super() functions as the 'gut connector' between the two objects you are linking. It lets you connect the methods between two objects.
