# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
     .forEach acts as a replacement for a for loop, meaning it iterates over all the objects in an array, where .map creates a new array.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
     A method exists inside an object.

3. What is closure?
     Closure is the usage of a Function's scope to manage the interaction of variables.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

     Window/Global Binding is when .this is bound to the entirety of a braowser's window, or a terminal, in the case of global.

     Implicit Bindiing  ties .this to whatever is to the left of the dot on an object.  

     Explicit Binding uses more specific keywords like .call, .apply, and .bind to explicitly bind them to an object.

     New Binding is for use in creating new Constructors and helps extend properties to them.


5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

     super() connects the extended class to the Parent, in order to inherit it's properties.
