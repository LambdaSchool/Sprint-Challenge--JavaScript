# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.<br>
`.forEach` : The  `.forEach`  method is great for going through an array and using index to manipulate the data <br> `.map`: Like `.forEach`, but `.map` will return a new array without mutating the original one.<br><br>


2. What is the difference between a function and a method?<br>
<blockquote>
	A function can stand on its own and not dependant on any data type; but a method is a special function that depends on other data type, object, or class and can be called from other methods.
</blockquote><br><br>


3. What is closure?<br>
<blockquote>	
is a function whithin a function (not a call back)
</blockquote><br><br>


4. Describe the four rules of the <code>this</code> keyword.<br>
<blockquote>
	- window/global binding: <code>this</code> references the window object (small w not Window)
	- Implicit Binding: <code>this</code> keyword will reference the object (when creating object literal)
	- Explicit Binding: we can use .call, .apply, or .bind and pass those methods a reference to what <code>this</code> is point to.
	- New Binding: when we create a class and instantiate an object, the <code>this</code> will now refer to that newly instantiated object. Each newly created object will have its own reference to <code>this</code>.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?<br>
<blockquote>	used to call the parent class 'constructor'  function and to inherit attributes from the parent.  Without it there would be no inheritance!
