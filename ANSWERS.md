# Your responses to the short answer questions should be laid out here using Mark Down.
1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
A: .forEach will iterate over a list of data just like .map does, however .map returns a new array of the transformed data whereas .forEach does not return anything.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
A: A function is something that can be passed parameters and can return data based on those parameters. It can independently be created and called. A method on the other hand is whenever a property/key is assigned the value of a function within an object/class. Therefore all methods are functions, but not all functions are methods.

3. What is closure?
A: A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) functionâ€™s variables.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
A: 1. Implicit Binding, 2. Explicit Binding, 3. New keyword Binding, and 4. Global Binding.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
A: This lets us pass any new attributes back up to the constructor of the parent object.
