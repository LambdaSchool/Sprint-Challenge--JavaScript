1. Briefly compare and contrast `.forEach` & `.map` (2-3 sentences max)

    Both are similar however .map returns a new array with transformed 
    elements while .forEach returns undefined. Also .map is chainable 
    while .forEach is not. This means .map can handle other calls like 
    .sort or .reduce after the .map call. This is something .forEach
    is not capable of. Also both methods do not mutate the array's 
    elements on its own without a callback function in use to do so. 


2. Explain the difference between a callback and a higher order function.

    A higher order function is the outer scope block within the function 
    a global scope could call. However a callback function can not be 
    invoked or called by the global scope. Only the higher order function's
    scope is capable of accessing the callback function. 

3. What is closure?
    
    Closure is a scope block a variable or function can be accessable within.
    Depending on how many nested curly braces there are closure can be increased
    or decreased. 

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
    That it will refer to a object's implict value set within the constructor.
    



5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

    Super in a extended class will allow the parent class to be accessible from
    the child class. So all properties a parent class have the child class will
    as well by just adding in the paramerters need within the parent construtor 
    through the super function inside of the child class.
