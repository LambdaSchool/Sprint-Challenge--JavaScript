1. Describe some of the differences between `.forEach` & `.map`.
While 'forEach()' function is a destructive function map is not.

'forEach()' is going to run a call back function on each element in the array and will modify every element that been called with the callback function. 

'map()' meanwhile, will do the same as 'forEach()', but instead of modifying the original array, will create a new array.

2. Name five different Types in JavaScript. A Type is something that can represent data. What is so special about Arrays?

number, string, boolean, object, array
Arrays can hold each data type at each indexes, including another array (called nested arrays) Array index starts with 0 index. let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
Elements can be accessed the following way:
arr[0] = 1
arr[1] = 2 and so on.
3. What is closure? Can you code out a quick example of a closure?
4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword. No need to provide examples about it this time :)
