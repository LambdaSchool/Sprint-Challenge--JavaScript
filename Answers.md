1. The biggest difference between the .forEach and .map methods is that .map returns an array. Both methods will filter over an array, apply a change or action, but .forEach alters the content of an array where as .map generates a new one.

2. Functions and methods are very similar because a method is a function stored in an object. So their biggest differences stems from where they are stored in our javascript structure.
