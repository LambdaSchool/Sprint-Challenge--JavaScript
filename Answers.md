1. forEach iterates over each element in an array and applies the designated function to each element.
    A new array is not returned. map transforms each element in an array and returns a new array with the same
    number of indexes as the original array. 
    
2. Boolean, Number, String, Null, and Undefined. Arrays are objects that can hold multiple elements of varying
    data types. One array can only hold one data type, i.e. string, number, although it has the capability of
    holding different types of data in general. There's a lot of flexibility that comes with arrays and handling
    large amount of data. 

3. A closure allows the local scope of a function to see outside of its scope, such as accessing a variable
    outside of the local scope. 

4. * This can be used with a function that is in the global scope.
   * This can be used with the dot operator.
   * This can be used with a constructor and refers to the object that was created.
   * This can also be explicitly defined with .call() or .apply().
