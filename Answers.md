1. Differences between .forEach and .map: 
  * .map returns a new array, wheras .forEach does not return anything.

2. Name five different Types in JavaScript. A Type is something that can represent data. What is so special about Arrays?
  * String, number, boolean, object, array. Arrays are special because they have many methods that can be applied to them, they can also be iterated over.

3. What is closure? Can you code out a quick example of a closure?
  * Closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain. The closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), it has access to the outer function's variables, and it has access to the global variables.

```
const counter = () => {
    let count = 0;
    return () => {
        count++;
        return count;
    };
};
const myCounter = counter();
myCounter();
```
