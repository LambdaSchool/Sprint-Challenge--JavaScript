1. The biggest difference between .forEach and .map is that .map returns a new array and .forEach does not.

2. The difference between a function and a method is that a method is a function within an object; a function doesn't necessarily have an object associated with it.

3. Closure is the ability for functions to access the outer scope. Child functions can access parent variables but outside functions cannot access variables (or really anything else for that matter) within another function.

4. This keyword properties:
    window - the global object and the parent of all the Javascript you write.
    new - creates a new object based off a constructor
    implicit - used within the object it is in
    explicit - outside of the object block but not the window

5. We need super() in an extended class because it replaces the calling of the parent constructor. super() is - on the basic level - .call
