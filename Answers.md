   ref https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-map-filter-reduce-in-javascript--cms-26209

   A map takes a list usually an array and runs(maps) a function or each element of that array. On each
   iteration remember to return or else you will have an array of undefinded elements. Maps returns a new array
   when finished iterating.
   Like map forEach saves you having to manage iterating through the a loop, for each does not return anything on each iteratiion so you can't chain it onto other functions. Map returns an array but forEach requires you to update or mutate the array you are managing in the forEach and declare it before the forEach loop
