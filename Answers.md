1. Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.

Answer: The biggest difference between .forEach and .map is that .forEach does not return a new array, while a .map does. They essentially do the same things, as the function iterates through an array, for each item in the array, both .forEach and .map will pass in a callback function that has the option to return the Item, Index (of that item), and Array (from which the item came from). 

The only thing is, .map iterates and generates a new array.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

A function is a block of code with its own scope and takes an input (parameter) and returns a value. A method, is when a function is called on an object.
