## Difference between forEach and map

<div style="display: block; position: absolute; background-color: black; color: white; text-align: center; border: solid orange 4px; border-radius: 2px;">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                .forEach only iterates while .map creates a new object while also iterating and testing a conditional on each element by an iterator
            </p>

            <h3>The common data types in JS are: </h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boolean</li>
                    <li>String</li>
                    <li>Buffer Array</li>
                    <li>Buffer String</li>
                    <li>Number</li>
                    <li>Objects</li>
                    <li>Null or "\u0000"</li>
                    <li>Undefined</li>
                    <li>Functions</li>

            <h3>What is Closure?: </h3>
            <p>
                Closure is essentially when a function reaches outside of it's scope and uses/accesses either another function or a variable to use within it's own scope.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>The 4 rules of this are:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If this isn't implicitly or explicitly bound to something then by default it is referencing the window object on the client side or the global object on the server side
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Whenever a constructor function is used, this refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Whenever JavaScriptâ€™s call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
