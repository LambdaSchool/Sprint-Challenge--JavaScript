1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

foreach searches through the entire array. Map also searches but creates a new array.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

a  function is defined outside of an object. A method is defined inside of an object.

3. What is closure?

Closure is scope and where a block of code ends.  

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

1. Without a scope this tries to go global
2. Implicit binding: it ties the object to inside the function or passed into it (block of scope)
3. New binding: to build new opjects
4. Explicit binding:holds value with a variable which can be called at a later time

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

To access and call functions on an object.
