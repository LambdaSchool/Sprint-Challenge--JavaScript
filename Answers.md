1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
forEach iterates through each item in an array and performs a function on it. Map creates a new array from calling a function on each item in the array. It doesn't alter the original array.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
A function runs code when called, while a method is a function called on an object.

3. What is closure?
A closure is like a backpack that can store data to be used later. For example, nested functions where the inner function does not run until the outer function is called. Also, the nested functions have access to variables and data from higher up.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
The four rules of the 'this' keyword are: 
1) Window/Global binding  
2) Implicit binding
3) Explicit binding
4) 'new' keyword binding

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
We need super() in an extended class in order to access the functions of the parent object. Similar to call(), but super is used in conjunction with constructor.
