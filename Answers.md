1. The biggest difference between .forEach & .map is that .forEach calls a provided function on every element in an array, where .map calls a provided function on every element in an array and then continues to create a new array from the results.

2. A function is a block of code used to perform a task, and is invoked when you call it, a method is a function that is associated with an object or class.

3. A closure is a bundled function where the inner function is able to access and call upon the outer functions variables.

4. 
1. Window Binding: If we are not using implicit, explicit, or new binding then 'this' will be the window object.
2. Implicit Binding: Happens when we use dot notation to call upon and invoke a function.
3. New Binding: Happens when we use 'new' to create a new object and points 'this' to the new object we have created.
4. Explicit Binding: Happens when we use .call() .apply() or .bind() on a function.

5. We need super() to give the child class access to 'this' and grant access to the parents methods.
