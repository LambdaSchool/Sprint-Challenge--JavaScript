     <li>.forEach will iterate through an entire array, running the passed function <i>for each</i> iteration whereas .map will do the same; however, .map returns an array rather usually modified at each iteration with the passed function, essentially <i>mapping</i> the array.</li>
     <li>Five types of data in JS are String, Number, Boolean, Symbol and Undefined. An Array is a <i>type of</i> data structure in which any <i>type of</i> data may be stored. Specific to Arrays, as apposed to other data structures, is that they are ordered and their elements may be accessed by their indices.</li>
     <li>A Closure is anything within a functions Scope. ie., function iHaveClosure(wuddaShuddaCudda) { var life = 'circumstantial'; return `I ${wuddaShuddaCudda} but life is ${life}. :[` In this case, the variable 'life' is only accessible within the Scope, in in <i>Closure</i>, of 'iHaveClosure' </li>
     <li>The four rules of the 'this' variable are, when in the according <u>Scope</u>, they represent said <u>Object</u>: Global => window -- preceding '.' => object before '.' -- with constructor function => the instance of the constructed object -- with .call, .apply or .bind => the passed object(implicit)</li>
</ol>
