**Q3**: What is closure? Can you code out a quick example of a closure?

In Javascript, closure is an inner function that has access to the environment outside it. For example, the outer function's variablesâ€”scope chain is accessible in the inner function. This also means it has access to global variables.

In the below example, you'll find that closure in Javascript means that the 'x' variable in the function will be bale to access the value of 'x' outside the function.

let x = 1;
function () {
  x++;
}
