What is the difference between a function and a method?
A method is a function inside of an object, pretty much the same thing. The only difference is that when you call a method, you need to do dot- or bracket-notation with the object it's inside.

What is closure?
A closure is the ability of a function to remember the surrounding scope that it is in.

Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
The four rules of the 'this' keyword are window binding, implicit binding, explicit binding, and new binding. The window binding is the default of using the 'this' keyword without an object where it refers to the window. Implicit binding refers to the left side of the dot when calling a function using the 'this' keyword that will act as the reference for 'this'. Explicit binding uses the function methods call, apply, or bind to bind the 'this' keyword to a specific object that will act as the reference for 'this'. The new binding is when you create a new object using the 'new' keyword that binds the 'this' keyword to that new object.

Why do we need super() in an extended class? 
We need super() in an extended class to bind the 'this' keyword to the new extended class.
