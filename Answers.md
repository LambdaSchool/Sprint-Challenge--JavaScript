1. The biggest difference between .forEach() and .map() is that .forEach() modifies the existing array while .map() returns a brand new array. Both allow you to return items that are different from the original item inputted to them, but only .map() preserves immutability in the original array data.

2. A method is a function, but a function is not always a method. Functions can be defined in the global scope, inside another function, or in multiple other use cases. Methods, in contrast, are functions that are assigned either inside of an object or to that object’s prototype. For instance, the Array object houses a variety of methods that allow you to traverse array data.

3. A closure is a defined environment where a function is stored or called and creates a lexical environment in which is holds variables and other objects in state for later user (even if they are outside of that function. For instance, a nested function inside another function will have access to all variables that are in scope at the time that it is called (or stored for later use).

4. The four “rules’ or principals of the this keyword are window binding, implicit binding, explicit binding, and the new keyword. The window binding rule is when, for instance, the this keyword is (usually accidentally) bound to the parent window through definition of it inside a function in the global scope; unless “use strict” is placed at the top of the inside of the function, this will bind to the window (the next layer up). In contrast, implicit binding happens when dot notation is used to invoke a function containing it. Explicit binding is when the this keyword is bound to an object through the use of the .call(), .apply(), .bind(), or other similar process. Finally, the new keyword instantiates a new object through a constructor function or class and binds the this statements in the constructor to the incoming object attributes.

5. The .super() method is used to access functions (methods) from an instantiated object’s (or child class’) parent object. Without this in place, we would not be able to call/invoke methods from the parent object.
