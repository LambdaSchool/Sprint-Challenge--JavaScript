# Difference between **forEach()** and **map()**:
## **map()**:
1. **map()** accumulates results into a collection 
2. **map()** transforms all elements of iterable/array
3. **map()** returns new array of same size with its newly transformed elements.
4. **map()** does not alter the original array
5. **map()** transforms one collection into another
6. **map()** works through two iterables; the input iterable and the output array.

## **forEach()**:
1. **forEach()** The only thing **forEach()** does is iterate over a collection and apply an operation to each element.
2. **forEach()** Does not return anything. 
3. **forEach()** does not care whether a value is returned or not.
4. **forEach()** works through a single collection at a time, unlike **map()**.
