1. forEach iterates over a list and doesn't return anything, it just calls the function for each array element. Map will call the function for each array element and capture and build a new array of those values.

2. Number, Boolean, String, Symbol, Object

3. Closure is an inner function that has access to the outer function's scope.

4. When a function is in the global scope, its value will be the window object. When a function is called by dot notation, the object right before the dot is "this". When a constructor function is used, this refers to the object created by the function. When .call or .apply method is used, that explicitly defines "this".
