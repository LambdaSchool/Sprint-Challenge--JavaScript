Q: What is closure?
A: Closure makes it possible for a function to have private variables.

Q: Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
A: 
1. Implicit Binding:
Implicit binding describes a situation where it's essentially *implied* that 'this' references the object the invocation is acting on.
2. Explicit Binding
Explicit binding describes a situation where you use 'call' on a function to tell it explicitly what context in which 'this' is referenced. 
3. New Binding
The 'new' keyword tells the function to create a new object, and that new object is what 'this' will reference.
4. window Binding
If none of the other rules are met, then JavaScript will default the this keyword to reference the window object.
