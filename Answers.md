1. '.forEach' and '.map' both iterate through an array's elements but '.forEach' only executes a given function, while '.map' executes a given function while also returning values for a new array.

2. A function is an executable block of code that runs when invoked. A method is a function, but instead of being stand-alone, is a child to an object.

3. Closure is the ability for nested functions to have access to variables declared in their parent functions. The nesting of the lexical environment of the parent function and the local environment of the child function acts as one giant closure.

4. 'this' refers to different objects according to each bind:window, implicit, explicit, and new. Window: when 'this' refers to the window/console object that global variables are attached to. Implicit: when 'this' refers to the object left of the dot or bracket in said notation. Explicit: When used during a call or apply, 'this' refers to the owner object of the function. New: When 'this' refers to a new instance of an object that is created using a constructor.

5. 'super()' invokes the parent class with the child classe's argument(s), allowing for any variables stored in the parent function to be stored in the child classes's constructor with it's own values used during the call.
