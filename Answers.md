1. The for Each loop is very much like a for loop, while the .map() method will enact a function on each item within the array.

2. Methods are prebuilt functions invoked within a function. They assist the function in providing the needed action.
   Functions are created to provide a purpose to a program. For example adding+/subracting-/multiplying* and division(/) 
   on a element or text field on a website. 

3. Closures are functions within a function. They also have access to the outer functions.

4. Implicit Binding = When you call a function, look to the left of the dot to see what .this keyword is refering to.

   Explicit Binding

    .call() = specifically call out what .this is refering to. Must be called one by one. 

    .apply() = same as .call() but will be called with arrays. Will only take 2 parameters.

    .bind() = same as .call() but it returns a new function. Takes one argument.

    New Binding = When you have a new keyword tied. The .this keyword is tied to the new object being created.

    Window Binding = If you are not using Explict, Implicit, or new bindings it will tie in to the window object. It will return errors, even when using strict mode. Or will output undefined. 

5. Using extends keywords inherits the classes attributes.
