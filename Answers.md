Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword. <br>
By default, 'this' in global scope is window bound (i.e. to the window object). In implicit binding, 'this' is pointing to the object whose scope it is within (i.e. "left of the dot"). In explicit binding, when we use the .apply, .call, or .bind methods we must specify what 'this' refers to within the method parentheses. In new binding, when using constructor functions, to prevent from getting undefined when we want to assign properties to the object, we need to use 'this' to refer to the object.
