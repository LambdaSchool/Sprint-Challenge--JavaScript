1. .forEach iterates through each item of an array and can access every elemnt. .map iterates over the array and can preform an operation with each element that it stores in a new array which is then returned. You would use .forEach to iterate over an array and you would use .map to iterate over an array and make changes to each element.
2.Five types in JavaScript are Object, function, string, number and boolean. Arrays are a special type of object that is a sequential list. The key values are sequential numbers. Arrays also have a set of functions on the array prototype that allow you to operate on an array in specific ways.
3.I can't really explain closure.
4.The four rules of 'this' are as follows:
    1. If this is in the global scope it refers to the global object. The window in chrome or the consosole in Node for example.
    2.It implicitly refers to the object that it is being called on if it is being called from an object.
    3. It explicitly can refer to a specific object using call or apply.
