1.  - forEach() — executes a provided function once for each array element.
    - map() — creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

2.  Functions are defined outside of classes, while Methods are defined inside of and part of classes.

3.  A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables—scope chain. 

4. Four rules are:
	- Global Object Binding (in the global scope, the value of “this” will be the window
	- Implicit Binding (a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this)
	- New binding (a constructor function is used, this refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function)
	- Explicit binding (JavaScript’s call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined)

5. Super() is used to  pass any new attributes back up to the constructor of the parent object.
