1. Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.
	While both are array methods, the key difference between each is that _.forEach_ is used to iterate a function once per item in an array, while _.map_ iterates a function over each array item, transforming each item in the list and returning a new, mutated array.
2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
	Though both are used to execute some code, a function is block of code that exists independently (usually contains it's own scope) and that returns a result; by contrast a method can be said to be a function that simply belongs to (exists dependently on) an object or class.
3. What is closure?
	A closure can be said to be the local environment (or scope) where a function is declared.
4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
	In the JavaScript language, 'this' can be a reference to one of four different types of binding including:
		A. New Binding
		B. Window Binding
		C. Explicit Binding
		D. Implicit Binding
5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
	Because properties and methods are not inherently passed down from one object to another in JavaScript, the super keyword must be used to access and call functions from an object's parent object.
