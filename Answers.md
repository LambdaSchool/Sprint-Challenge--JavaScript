<!-- 

1. Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.
The biggest difference is that .forEach mutates the original array while .map creates a copy of the original array and mutates that one.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
Methods are functions INSIDE of objects. A regular function is just in the global scope.

3. What is closure?
Essentially it's nested functions. Inner functions will have access to everything in the outer functions' scope. 

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
    1. Window/Global Binding
    2. Implicit Binding
    3. Explicit Binding
    4. new Keyword Binding

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class? 
super() allows us to pull all the "guts"/"values" from the parent constructor function, from the extended class, into our child constructor function.
