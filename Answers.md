The biggest difference between .forEach & .map is .forEach only iterates through every array item without returning it in a array while map iterates and pushes every item in a array.

A function can be considered as a variable and Method is a function inside a object.

Closure is a variable that is stored in memory for future use of other nested functions.

Window Binding- If there is no binding present in a object it is binded to the window.
Implicit Binding- Binding of this keyword to a function or object.
Explicit Binding- It is the binding of global variables together by using .call .apply , .bind method that is built in objects.
New Binding- It consists of constructor functions and the New keyword to create new Objects.
