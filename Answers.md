3. What is closure?
functionA(){
    variable1
    functionB(){
        variable1
        variable2
    }
    functionC(){
        variable1
        variable3
    }
}
4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
    Super ties the extended class to the main class. Without super, you won't get the functions or the object properties.
