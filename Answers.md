<!-- Question 1 -->
.forEach returns undefined, but .map returns an array of the same size as the input array.

<!-- Question 2 -->
A method is a function on an object, ie, a function stored as a value in a key:value pair.

<!-- Question 3 -->
Closure is when a nested function has access to variables that are outside of it (the nested function) but within the scope of the function within which it is nested.

<!-- Question 4 -->
1. 'this' binds to the window object.
2. Implicit binding: 'this' binds to whatever invokes it.
3. Explicit binding: .call, .apply, or .bind is used to define the context of 'this'.
4. The 'new' keyword is used to bind 'this' to a new instance of a constructor function.

<!-- Question 5 -->
super() is used to access and call functions on an object's parent. It ensures that the properties and methods of the parent will be accessible to the child.
