1. For each iterates through an array and doesn't return anything. Map function returns a new array with the changed values. 
2. The five different types are variables, arrays, objects, functions, and callbacks. Arrays can hold multiple values and they are index based and ordered. 
3. A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer function; scope chain or like a function within a function. 
let function Sumi() {
    let name = "Sumayyah"
    function wantsIcecream() {
        return true;
    };
    console.log(name.wantsIcecream);
};
4. Window/Global Object Binding - when in the global scope the value of this refers to the window.
   Implicit Binding - When theres a dot before the object name after invoking. Object is calling the function, this refers to the object property.
   New Binding - whenever you use a constructor function is used. 
   Explicit Binding - When you use the call or apply function.
