1. `.forEach` executes a function on every element in an array and `map` creates a new array on using a function.  
2. `Strings`, `Booleans`, `Number`, `Object`, `Null`
3. A function that has access to an outer variable.
  let i = 0
  function cl(){
    return i + 1;
  }
4. `implicit binding` (`this` left of the dot), `window binding`(`this` isn't declared so it refers to window object), expliciting binding (this is binded using call, apply and bind), `new binding`(uses new key to bind object to this).
