1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

  The biggest difference is that `.map` returns a new array, while `.forEach`
  acts like a for loop, iterating through each index of the array and performing
  the requested function upon it.  For example, `.forEach` can mutate an
  existing array, while `.map` will return a new array mutated from the original.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  A function is a block of code that be declared in a program, and then re-used,
  throughout a program by invoking it.  A method is a function that is bound to
  and object, usually by being declared inside of that object, or attached to
  that object's prototype.  Methods must be invoked through an object, while
  functions can be invoked independently.

3. What is closure?
  Closure refers to the way in which functions can access data outside of their
  local scope.  If a function is nested inside of another function, the nested
  function can access any data from the outside function.  This is done with
  lexical scoping, which means that the function will remember that data as it
  was in the original function declaration, not the state of that data at the
  time of invoking.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
  * Global/Window binding
      When used outside of an object, this will refer to the global, or window
      scope object.
  * Implicit binding
      When this is used inside of an object, it is bound to that object.  When
      a this property or method is invoked, it is bound to the object to the
      left of the dot in the invocation statement.
  * Explicit binding
      this can be bound to any object you choose by using the `.apply`, `.call`,
      or `.bind` methods.  `.apply` and `.call` will invoke a function, with this
      bound to the item(s) used as arguments, while `.bind` will return a new
      instance of the function it is called on with this bound to the argument
      passed into `.bind`.
  * New binding
      If this is used in a constructor function, this will be bound to whatever
      object is return by that constructor function.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
  super() allows the extended class' constructor to pass up parameters needed by
  the parent class(es)' constructor to allow the it to return a new object
  correctly.
