*Booleans

..*Arrays are special because arrays allow you to do so much with them and the information inside of them. That's very resourceful for a programmer. Especailly when dealing with so much information. Being able to alter things within an array with simple commands, make our life easier. Also can arrays store the many different "Types" I listed above.

4. 
5. Four rules of `.this` keyword are:
