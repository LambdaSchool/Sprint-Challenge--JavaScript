<!-- 1. Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.  forEach executes a function once for each array. .map creates a whole new array.

 2. What is the difference between a function and a method? A function can return values while a method is inside the  class.


3. What is closure? Has to do with the scope and it has access to outer functions and global variables.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.  Window binding will be in the while window. Implicit Binding comes before  the dot. New Binding is specific. Explicit is controlled by what we assign it to.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class? Super skips the prototypes and inherits the necessary functions. -->
