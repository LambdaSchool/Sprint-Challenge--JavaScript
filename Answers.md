/*

1- The difference between forEach and map.
    The forEach method does not return, it simply calls a function on each element of the array.
    The map method does have a return statement, It return an array of the same size.
    
2-A method is a function that is declared within an object, the function can also be method if it is declared on the global scope but bound 
    to the window object or called like this window.nameAfunction()
    A function can be of different forms anonymous, expression, declaration,Functions are executed when they are called. Values can be passed into functions and used within the function
    
3- A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer functions around it and their variables.
    it is the comibation between the function and the lexical env it was declared in.
    
4-the four rules of this
    * window binding
    * implicit binding
    * explicit binding
    * using the new keyword(binding with new).
    
5- you need super() to be able to inherit the parents properieties and attributes.
