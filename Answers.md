    Describe some of the differences between .forEach & .map.
    Name five different Types in JavaScript. A Type is something that can represent data. What is so special about Arrays?
    What is closure? Can you code out a quick example of a closure?
    Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword. No need to provide examples about it this time :)


# '.forEach' iterates over a list and transforms each element in that list. It doesn't return anything, it just calls itself over each element. Returns of those elements will need to be explicitly stated. '.map' similarly iterates over a list and transforms each element, but will build a new array of those transformed elements instead of discarding them (as .forEach does).
