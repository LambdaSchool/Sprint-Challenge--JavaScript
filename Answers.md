The biggest difference is the map actually creates another array with the changes made by the function on each item in the original array. Foreach initiates the function on the the items in the array, but does not create a new array.

A method is a function within an object and a function is not within an object.

Closure is when a function within another function has access to the outer function's variables. It also has access to global functions.

1. Is the function call by new?
2. Is the function called by call(), apply(), or bind()?
3. Is the function called by a method?
4. Is the function called in the global scope? 

We need super() to call down the this. properties and methods from the object we are inheriting from.
