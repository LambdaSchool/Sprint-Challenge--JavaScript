<!-- 
1. Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.
 
  .forEach - accesses the items in  an array that come back with each pass.
  .map - returns a new array of elements while passing each element back to the callback.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method? 
   a function looks outward for context. When a function is declared it creates a new scope. 


3. What is closure? 
   Closures is a variable being referenced in the outer scope. 


4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
 
 1.) Window Global - In global scope, value of ’this’ will be window/console object.
 2.) Implicit Binding - When a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before the dot is considered the ‘this’.
 3.)New Binding - When you call a constructor function using the “new” keyword.
 4.)Explicit Binding - When a method is attached such as . call, and .apply that override a constructor.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class? 
   super() is used to  to tell a parent’s constructor to be concerned with the child’s attributes. -->
