1. Describe some of the differences between .forEach & .map.

   `.forEach` iterates over an array and invokes a function on each element.    `.map` does the same but takes the return from each and puts it into an array, ⋅⋅⋅which it then returns.

2. Name five different Types in JavaScript. A Type is something that can represent data. What is so special about Arrays?

   * Number
   * Null
   * Undefined
   * Boolean
   * Object
   * String

   Arrays are objects that have indexed values which gives them a specific order.     This makes them very easy to iterate over (using the Array.prototype methods).

3. What is closure? Can you code out a quick example of a closure?

   A closure gives access to an outer scope from an inner function. 

   ```const givePizza = 'Have a slice of pizza!';

   function gimmiePizza() {
       return givePizza;
   }

   gimmiePizza();```

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword. No need to provide examples about it this time :)

   * Global - when the function is invoked in the global space `this` will point to the global object
   * Implicit - when the function is invoked with a dot in front `this` will point to the object before that dot
   * new - when the function is invoked from a class constructor `this` will point to the new object that is created
   * Explicit - when the function is invoked with a `.call()` or `.apply()` method this will point to the parameter given
