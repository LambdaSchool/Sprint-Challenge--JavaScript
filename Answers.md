# Difference between **forEach()** and **map()**:
## **map()**:
1. **map()** accumulates results into a collection 
2. **map()** transforms all elements of iterable/array
3. **map()** returns new array of same size with its newly transformed elements.
4. **map()** does not alter the original array
5. **map()** transforms one collection into another
6. **map()** works through two iterables; the input iterable and the output array.

## **forEach()**:
1. **forEach()** The only thing **forEach()** does is iterate over a collection and apply an operation to each element.
2. **forEach()** Does not return anything. 
3. **forEach()** does not care whether a value is returned or not.
4. **forEach()** works through a single collection at a time, unlike **map()**.


# Six different types in JavaScript:
1. **Object**--techically everything's an object. JS also uses a data structure called an object for OOP.
2. **Number**--Self explanatory.
3. **String**--A piece of information a person might read. Usually placed in between double or single quotes.
4. **Boolean**--My favorite. Can be either true or false. Like a light switch. Conditional syntax and base cases can thank booleans for their existence. 
5. **Null**--Null is an object--a variable has been declared but not yet assigned.
6. **Undefined**--undefined is its own data type--null can be assigned to a variable to represent no value.
