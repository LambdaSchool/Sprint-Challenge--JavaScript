##### 1. Describe some of the differences between .forEach & .map.
...forEach doesn't return a value like map does. Also map created a new array for mapping out the elements within an array and forEach just goes through each individual element without creating a new array. ForEach will also use the callback function to mutate the array or return something from it while map just creates a new array that can keep duplicating and muliplying into new arrays which can make it better in programming.

##### 2. Name five different Types in JavaScript. A Type is something that can represent data. What is so special about Arrays?
...The five different types in JavaScript are: variables, arrays, objects, functions and callbacks. Arrays represents a chain of elements that can have other data added to it, deleted from it, multiply each element and more.

##### 3. What is closure? Can you code out a quick example of a closure?
...Closure has access to the information inside of the function body by calling it outside of the scope of the function.

##### 4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
...Principle 1 is the Window/Global which in the console the this keyword is a global concept. Principle 2 is Implicit Binding which basically has a term followed by the dot. Principle 3 is New Binding which is very specific of that object. Lastly Principle 4 is Explicit Binding which uses the .call and .apply to call a specific element within the function.
