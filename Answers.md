and executes on its own. A method is a type of function that is a part of an object, and generally uses the items of that object.

4. Implicit binding is when "this" refers to the item is called with (whats on the left of the dot). 
Explicit binding, is when we are using a function, when we pass in values to a function that use the "this" keyword this is called explcit binding. 
New binding is when we use a constructor function, "this" is created behind the scenes and refers to the new object.
Window binding is when this isnt referring to anything, it will default to the window object.

5. Super() allows us to access the functions of a parent object.
