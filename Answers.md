1. Id say the biggest differense between map and foreach is that foreach executes a     function for each array element whereas map creates a new array  with the results    of calling a function.

2. A function is defined outside of an object and a method is defined as the            property within an object.

3. A closure is a funtion that can run using information that is  outside of the        functions scope.

4.   1. Window binding - This being bound to the window by default.

     2. Implicit - When the binding is implied being in the same block of code and       using dot notation.

     3  new - Adds a new object to an array. 
     
     4. Explicit - Using specific keywords to call the funtion ex. apply, call, or      bind.

5. To use as a communication device between child and parent constructors.
