1. Both `map` and `forEach` iterate over an array and run a function for every item, but `map` returns a new array.
2. A method is just a function that is a property in an object.
3. Closure describes what a given function has access to based on it's scope. A function has access to a variable that inhabits the same scope as the function. So for example, if scope lookes like `Global scope -> Parent scope -> Child scope -> Grandchild scope` a function in `child` scope has access to variables in `global` and `parent` scopes but not `grandchild`.
4. * Window binding--when using "this" keyword in the global scope, the value defaults to the window Object.
   * Implicit binding--value of "this" becomes the object on the left side of a function call. 
   * New binding--value of "this" becomes an object created by the constructor function containg the "this" keyword.
   * Explicit binding--"this" is defined by a call or apply method.
5. `super()` sort of replaces `call`. It gives the parent object accest to the attributes of the childobject.
