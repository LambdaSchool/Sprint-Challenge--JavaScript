1. forEach() is used when you need to execute a function for each element in the array but doesn't return anything and .map() is used when you want to transform elements in an array and it actually returns a new array.
2. A function can be excecuted if you call it and a method is a function within an object 
3. A closure is a function within another function that has access to the outer function's variables and paramaters.
4. Window binding: When we don't use apply() .call() .bind() or the 'new' keyword, the 'this' keyword bound to the window object. 
   Implicit binding: When a dot notation is used to invoke a function.
   New binding: Is used inside a constructor function and can bind to any object with dot notation outside of the  constructor.
   Explicit binding: is when .apply() .call() .bind() are used on a function.

5. Super() is used to call the parent constructor methods.
