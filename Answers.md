2. Name five different Types in JavaScript. A Type is something that can represent data. What is so special about Arrays?
3. What is closure? Can you code out a quick example of a closure?

2. Array, string, integer, object, Arrays have a lot of methods attached to them, that allow to sort etc. Also arrays are mutable.
3. Closure has to do with a scope. Essentially it's when an inner function has access to the outer or global variables. Typical example would be console.log inside of the inner function that has access to console object from the inside.
