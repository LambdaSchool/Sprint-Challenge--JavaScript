Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
     1. Implicit Binding - When a funtion in invoced, if you look to the left of the dot, that is what is being referenced.
     2. Explicit Binding - This occurs when .call()- pass one by one, .apply()-pass on with an array, or .bind()- same as .call but returns new function to invoke later,  are used in a function
     3. New Binding - when a function is invoked with the new keyword, the this keyword inside that function is bound to the new object being constructed.
     4. Window Binding - if non of the rules apply, the this key word will default to the windo object.
Why do we need super() in an extended class?
