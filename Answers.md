/*1. Describe the biggest difference between .foreach and map.
.forEach. mutates the array. .map returns a new array.
*/
/*2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
A method is, in fact a function. It is a function that is the value in the property of an object.
*/
/*3. What is closure?
This is a nested child function where the parent cannot access the child's scope but the child can access the parent's.
*/
/*4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
When as new instance is created, 'this' becomes bound to the context of the object.
This is bound to the window/global object unless specified otherwise.
Using .call(), .apply(), and .super() explicitly binds this to the context of an object.
Invoking a method binds this to the context of the object.
*/
/*5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
Super() binds 'this' of the class properties of the parent to the class it is used in.
