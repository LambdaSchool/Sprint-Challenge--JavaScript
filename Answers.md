1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
<!-- .foreach calls a function for each array. .map calls a function for each and with the results it creates a new array  -->

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
<!-- Functions are self contained and called independently. Methods are called by an object or instance. -->

3. What is closure?
<!-- A closure is a internal fuction that has the ability to access outer functions. The closure is created when one fuction is placed within another function. -->

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

<!--
 a. new is used to call functions and becomes a new object. 

b. If apply, bind or call are used the object is passed in as an argument.

c. If a function is invoked without any conditions it becomes a global object within its window.

d. If a dot notation (. on the left of a function) is used to invoke a function .this is the object that the function is property of.  -->

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
 <!-- Super() calls the functions within the parent of an  object. -->
