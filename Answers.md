1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.
The main difference is that .map creates a new array whereas .forEach 
will call the function you create on each element in an array.
In other words .forEach will mutate an array but .map creates an entirely new one.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?
A method is just a function created within an object and a regular function is not.

3. What is closure?
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together 
with references to the lexical environment. It gives you access 
to an outter function's scope from an inner function.

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
It provides clarity when we are using objects and 
trying to bind them (either explicitly or implicitly) via invocation.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
