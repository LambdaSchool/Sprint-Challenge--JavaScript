1. forEach iterates over each item in an array without returning anything and map creates a new array and returns something for each item

2. A function is defined outside of an object where as a method is defined inside of the object


3. -Window/global - points to the window because it is global and isn't refrencing anything
  -Implicit binding - point to the object. Anything before the dot is the object
  -Explicit binding - points to the function.
  -New binding - creates new objects to be used in a function

  4. We use super to pass any new attributes back up to the base object
