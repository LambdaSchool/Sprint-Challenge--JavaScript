2.function and methods are the same, but a function is called a method when it's inside an object.

  Implicit- Whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before that dot is this.
  New- Whenever a constructor function is used, this refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned by the constructor function.
  Explicit- Whenever JavaScript’s call or apply method is used, this is explicitly defined.
