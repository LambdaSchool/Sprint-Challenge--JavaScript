//Javascript - Sprint Challenge

1. The. forEach() method loops through an array similarly to a for loop without modifying each element as it is iterating through and it executes a provided function to each element. The .forEach() loop does not return any value as it just loops through the array. The .map() method also loops through an array but returns a new array with the updated values that result from executing a function on each element.

2. A Javascript object contains properties and methods that can be defined when creating the object. The main difference between a function and a method is that methods are functions that are defined as a property to an object.

3. Closure is how a function is able to access values from outside of the scope created by the function. Closure uses lexical scope to provide context and access to variables that are defined outside a function. This is generally the case when a function is defined within another function.

4. The four rules of the 'this' keyword are as follows:
   Implicit binding: automatically binds the 'this' keyword to the object that is to the left of the function that is invoked
   Explicit binding: manually bind the 'this' keyword to an object by passing the object as an argument of the .call or .apply method of a function
   New binding: binds the 'this' keyword to a new object by creating the object from a constructor function
   Window binding: the default state for the 'this' keyword which refers to the window in which javascript is running

5. The super() method is used inside of an extended class to bind the 'this' keyword to the properties of a parent class by passing an object to the parent's constructor function.
