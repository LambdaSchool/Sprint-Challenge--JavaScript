1. Describe the biggest difference between `.forEach` & `.map`.

  - .forEach() changes and affects our original array. Whereas .map()
  returns and new/altered array with objects/properties/parameters, leaving
  the original array unchanged.

2. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  - Function is a set of code to do some task in JavaScript.
    Method is also a function which is used as a property applied to a Object.
    A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.

3. What is closure?
  - A closure when when another element such as a function/declaration
    is classed from outside of the functions local scope

4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
  - Is the function called by new
    Is the function called by call(), apply(), or bind()
    Is the function called as a method
    Is the function called in the global scope

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?
  - The super() keyword in javascript is used in order to call the methods of the
    parent class. This is often used within a constructor function to call the parent
    constructor function.
