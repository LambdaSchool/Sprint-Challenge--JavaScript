// ======================== Self Study ====================================
//1. Using '.forEach' performs a function once on each element when it iterates over a list. The results from that function can change the array elements but will return 'undefined'. Using mapping on a list will return a new array; no changes are made to the original.

// 2. Variables, Objects, Functions, Callbacks & Arrays.  Arrays are a group of objects but considered as one.  They are called individually by their index which starts at 0.

// 3. Closure is a concept referring to a function's scope.  When a function is created, it creates its own scope. Variables declared in it are not seen outside of it although the function can obtain variables outside of itself to refernce. The function itself can be used globally.

<!-- const brandName = 'Fender';
function guitarName() {
    const styleName = 'Jazzmaster';
    alert(`Nels Cline likes to play ${brandName} ${guitarName}`);
}  -->

// 4. Window Binding - the value of 'this' is a console object when referenced globally.
      Implicit Binding - using 'this.' followed by a key value within a function, that represents the object literal name.
      New Binding - using '.this' in a constructor function will create a new object.
      Explicit Binding - using '.call' and '.apply' can replace/override the properties of an object.
