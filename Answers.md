The biggest difference is forEach doesn't return anything at all and map will call a function like forEach but also return a value and return a new array.

methods are actions that can be produced on objects. A function is very similar to a method but it usually houses methods and it explicitly passes data.

closures are functions inside of another function that remembers the environment it was created in.

the default binding, implicit binding, explicit binding and new binding.

super references the parent class of the extended class.
