Task #2

1. forEach loops over an array and calls what ever function is passed in as it's parameter for every element in the array. map does the same thing except it passes the result of the given function to a new array.

2. a method is an object property that contains a function.

3. a closure is when a child or grandchild function has access to varibles in the parents scope.

4. Global binding - Default context of the "this" key word. also known as window binding.

Implicit binding - "this" keyword is refering to the whatever is to the left of the dot when the function is called. (i.e. User.this User would be the context of "this".)

Explicit binding - The context of 'this' is explicitly stated by using methods such as .call or .apply.

new binding - New binding is when a new instance of an object is created using a class constructor the properties of that object are then binded to the new object and returned.

5. super is used in an extended class to bind properties from the parent constructor to the new one.
