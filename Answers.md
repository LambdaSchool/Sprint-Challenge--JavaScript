1. The biggest difference between .forEach and .map is that .map returns a new array, while .forEach loops over the array.
2. Functions are defined outside of classes, while methods are defined inside and part of classes. 
3. Closure is a collection of all the variables created within the function.
4. Four rules of 'this' keyword is window, implicit, explicit and new binding. In window binding, "this" becomes a global object. In implicit binding, object preceding the dot is 'this'. Explicit uses .call, .apply or .bind. New binding will create a new object. 
5. We need super() in an extended class to send information back to the parent object.
