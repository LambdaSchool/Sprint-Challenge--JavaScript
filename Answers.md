The difference between .forEach and .map: .forEach executes a function for every array element.
.map will make a new array with the results of the function on the elements.

The difference between function and method: Functions are self contained and called independently. Methods are called by an object or instance.


What is a closure: A closure is a internal fuction that has the ability to access outer functions. The closure is created when one fuction is placed within another function.

The 4 rules of .this: 
1. new is used to call functions and becomes a new object. 

2. If apply, bind or call are used the object is passed in as an argument.

3. If a function is invoked without any conditions it becomes a global object within its window.

4. If a dot notation (. on the left of a function) is used to invoke a function .this is the object that the function is property of.

5. Super() call the functions within the parent of an  object.
