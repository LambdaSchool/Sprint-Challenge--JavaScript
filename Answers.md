1. foreach executes a function for each element in an array without returning a new array, while map will do the same but create and return a new array.

2. A function can be ran standalone while a method is contained within a parent object.

3. Closure is when code has access to variables above it in scope.

4. The this keyword is used to reference the current object or binding. Honestly can't think of any rules.

5. Super is used to access/invoke methods on a parent object.
