While .forEach() iterates the same method over an each object in an array, it doesn't return a new array like .map() does.
 A function is a code that can return or log a certain value given parameters. A method is the same, however it is only applicable inside of a class.
 Closure is the product of nesting a function inside of another function. With it the function that is nested inside of another function can reach into its parent function and access any variables declared there.
 1. 'this' is used globally when it is in the global scope, being called to the global object. 2. A function that is called and is left of the dot is 'this'. 3. When a new object is made using a constructor function the 'this' being referred to is that function. 4. When the .apply() and .call() methods are invoked 'this' is implied for those objects. 
 The super() allows programmers to gain access to the parent class and all of its properties.
