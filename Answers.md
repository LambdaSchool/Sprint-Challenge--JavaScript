 the main diffrence between foreach & map is that "map" acumulates a collection of data from everything it goes through and foreach just runs an action on every element it goes through.

 the major diffrence between methods and functions is that methods are tied to a specific class

 closure is the accessibility of a variable in its lixicle scope

 there is default binding where 'this' refers to global scope, implicit binding is when "this" is called by a preceding dot the object for it is "this", new binding is when a constructor function is in use "this" refers to the object created by that constructor function,  explicit binding is when javascripts call or apply method is in use and "this" is explicitly defined.
 
 super is a keyword use to call functions from parent object onto child object.
