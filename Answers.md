1. The biggest difference between the .forEach and .map methods is that .map returns an array. Both methods will filter over an array, apply a change or action, but .forEach alters the content of an array where as .map generates a new one.

2. Functions and methods are very similar because a method is a function stored in an object. So their biggest differences stems from where they are stored in our javascript structure.

3. Every time a function is created so is closure. This closure creates an environment where explicit rules are introduced regarding a functions ability to access the global and functional scope. These rules dictate whether or not a specific funciton will have access to certain variables. This all dependence on corresponding inheritence and general document structure.
