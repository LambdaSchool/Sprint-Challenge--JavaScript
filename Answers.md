.forEach does not return any values ~ .map returns a new array

function, object, string, number, boolean
all arrays are objects, but not all objects are arrays
an array stores data similarily to an object...the index acts as the object's key, and the array element acts as the object's value

closure refers to a nested function that has access to its' parent scope

implicit binding - the object to the immediate left of the function's invocation is what THIS will refer to
explicit binding - utilizes .call / .apply / .bind to directly state which object is passed to THIS
window binding - if there is no reference to an object when the function is invoked, a global object will be assigned
new binding - creates a new instanace of the constructor and passes its' own values to THIS
