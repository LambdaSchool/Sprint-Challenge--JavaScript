The difference between .forEach and .map are that .forEach doesn't return a new array where as .map does. .forEach and .map will call a function to each element of your array.
I think the biggest difference between a method and a function is location, location, location. A method is a defined function that is a property of an object. a function is defined outside of the object.
A closure is an inner function that has access to the information of its outer function/parent function. It has three scopes in that it has access to its own variables, it's parents variables, and global variables.
The 'this' keywords four rules or types are implicit, explicit, new and window/global. implicit is where your this refers to whatever is left of the dot. explicit works when you use .call, .apply. or .bind.when using new, javascript will create a new object where the 'this' keyword is bound to the new object being made.when this keyword isn't specified to a function its considered to be global/or on the window.
We need super() in an extends class because thats how we access and call functions on the objects parents, instead of having to duplicate code.
